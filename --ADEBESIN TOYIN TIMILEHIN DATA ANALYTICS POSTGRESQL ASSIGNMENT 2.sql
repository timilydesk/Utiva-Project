/* DAMILARE'S COMMENT:
	    Hey cash madam,
	    What you have done wuld show each team and their corresponing total games played
	    ayou then tried to use the MAX fctn to get the team with the highest game played 
	    but this would only return the highest game played per team.
	    
	    we would be correcting this in class.
	    
	    Great technique trying to sort by games played in DESC order
